# Front-end-React-phase-3-project
Basic front end to interact with my backend server

User Story: 
You should be able to see a list of users that have tasks to do. You have the ability to click the button under done and that will present the opportunity to delete the task from the table and the backend. Then the next task will appear. Once all todos are gone, the table row will be empty.
